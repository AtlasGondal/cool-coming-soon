# Cool Coming Soon
quick way to setup maintenance or coming soon mode in wordpress websites

## Description

The Cool Coming Soon plugin allows you to quickly & easily set up a Coming Soon Page. It’s recommended to start new website with coming soon page, and highly recommended to use during maintenance. Admin sometime breaks website, during maintenance or customization tasks. The broken site will leave bad impression on your visitors, and may leak sensitive information such as internal directory structures. You can prevent that, by using this small utility.

This plugin will add a page called “Cool Coming Soon” under Settings. You can navigate there and enable/disable maintenance mode and can customize front-end data along with display options.
